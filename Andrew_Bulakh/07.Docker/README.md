## Homework Assignment 2: Building a Docker Image with Dockerfile
Dockerfile
```bash
     FROM python:3.8-slim
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
     COPY . .
     CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

File app.py
```bash
     from flask import Flask
     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/')
     def home():
         return "Hello, Docker!"

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```   

File requirements.txt
```bash
    Flask
```    

Create a Docker image
```bash
andrew@andrew-VirtualBox:~/07.docker/myapp$ sudo docker build -t myflaskapp .

Launching the container
```bash 
andrew@andrew-VirtualBox:~/07.docker/myapp$ sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 myflaskapp
 * Serving Flask app 'app'

```

When I visit/refresh the page in the browser at http://localhost:5000, I see the message "Hello, Docker!" on the page. And in the terminal it appears:
```bash
